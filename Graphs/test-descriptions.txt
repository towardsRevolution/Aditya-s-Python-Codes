**NOTE: Every new addition/alteration in the test files (i.e. test1,test2 and test3) is with respect to the "CowsNPaintBalls.txt" file

1). test1.txt : Coordinates of the cows and paintballs are interchanged amongst
                themselves, just the coordinates of YELLOW are altered to a new set
                of coordinates. Also, a cow is added at a new coordinate.

2). test2.txt : Coordinates of the cows and paintballs remain the same, just the coordinates of
                YELLOW are altered to a new set of coordinates. Also, another
                paintball (with a different color) and a cow are added at two new coordinates.
                (Note: In this case, the newly added paintball paints the cows).

3). test3.txt : Coordinates of YELLOW are altered to a new set of coordinates. Also, two cows and
                a paintball are added at a new set of coordinates. However, the paintball (PURPLE,
                in this case) is added at a location from which it will neither trigger another paintball
                nor will it paint any cow.
